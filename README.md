## Whatâ€™s Inside?
Currently this application contains many amazing community projects, such as:

- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)module bundler with webpack-dev-server, html-webpack-plugin and style-loader
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io)with ES6 and extensions used by Facebook (JSX, object spread, class properties)
- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)
- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

This application is [dockerized](https://hub.docker.com/r/rdpanek/monitor/) and here is [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) [recipe](https://github.com/test-stack/monitor/blob/master/kubernetes.yaml)

## Folder Structure

After clone this repository, you see:

```
monitor/
  README.md
  .babelrc - config for babeljs
  .dockerignore - exclude directory when creating docker image
  .gitignore
  Dockerfile - recipe for create dockerized application
  kubernetes.yaml - recipe for run dockerized application in Kubernetes environment
  package.json - recipe for CLI instalation
  server.json - backend layer

```

After run application, your see additional files and directories.

## Available Scripts

In nodeJS / Yarn environment:

- `yarn client` run frontend part application
- `ELASTIC_URI=http://IP:9200 yarn server` run backend part application
- `yarn unit` run unit tests and watcher ( for development )
- `yarn filldata` remove old slots from elasticsearch and create a new slots by counter. This is extended integration tests.
- `yarn integration` run integration tests
- `yarn start` run application for production environment

## Tests

This project contains many tests, e.g. unit tests, e2e and integration tests

### Unit tests
run via `yarn unit`

```
monitor/
  src/
    components/
      *.test.jsx
```

### E2E Tests

run via [Harness](https://github.com/test-stack/harness) e2e test-stack environment

1. docker run -it --name harness -v `PWD`/e2eTests/:/home/harness rdpanek/docker_harness:1.6
2. continue in [Harness](https://github.com/test-stack/harness) documentation

### Integration Tests

Integration tests for endpoint API `/api/slots`.

Run via `yarn integration`

```
monitor/
  tests/
    slots.js
```

## How To Run

### CLI

For development:

  1. `ELASTIC_URI=http://IP:9200 yarn server` - backend part
  2. `yarn client` - backend client
  
  
For production use:

- `yarn start`

### Docker

Re-build Docker image:
- docker build rdpanek/monitor:tag .

\- or -

- you can use auto-build image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rdpanek/monitor/)


then run

run image: `docker run --name monitor -e ELASTIC_URI=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:9200 -p 3000:3000 rdpanek/monitor:latest`

### Kubernetes
Fill `ELASTIC_URI` and run

`kubectl create -f kubernetes.yaml`

and check log

`kubectl logs -f pod`


## How To Use

This application has a WEB and REST-API interface. When is application run, then schedulled presentations is available on default URI `IP:PORT`. Administration interface is available on uri `IP:PORT/#/admin`


### Browser

Browser interface allows to displayed schedulled presentations or Administration interface.

Administration interface contains Timeline, which show schedulled presentations, so called Time Slots added via form CREATE SLOT and Background Time Slots added via REST-API.

If exist Time Slot and Background Time Slot in the same time, then Background Time Slot has higher priority, so in Presentation view will be show the Background Time Slot.

Click on CREATE SLOT button show intuitive dialogue for create Time Slot. To field `URI` must contain URI web application. Beware of `X-FRAME-OPTIONS` in headers. Fields from and to must be unique for Time Slot and Banckground Time Slots. Colors is useful for identification more Time Slots on Timeline. Background Time Slots has predefined color.

### API

REST-API is useful for sending command for show presentation from other tools., e.g. Show Kibana Dashboard with latests results of performance tests from now to 10min laters.

You can use REST-API endpoint `IP:PORT/api/slots` and send this payload

```
{
    "from": "09:58:30",
    "to": "09:58:40",
    "color": "background",
    "title": "Performance tests analysis summary | Smoke",
    "type": "background",
    "uri": "http://my-kibana.xyz:31159/goto/254cb2303c9dca4d3786eaa9bc8ae5e1"
}
```
The form of this payload must remain unchanged. You can change only:

- `from` format: HH:mm:ss
- `to` format: HH:mm:ss
- `title` is useful for Presentation layer, when a banner is displayed with the name of the application to be displayed. Title is used in Timeline for name of Time Slots and Background Time Slots
- `uri` Beware of `X-FRAME-OPTIONS` in headers.

The Background Time Slots has higgher priority than Time Slots. When is time to show Background Time Slot, is shown instead Time Slots.

Response must contain property `created` with value `true`


## Elasticsearch

In elasticsearch is stored Time Slots and Background Time Slots in `monitor-slots` index. If not exist, it will be automatically created.
